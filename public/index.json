Antiviral treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors has been recommended to treat patients with H7N9 infection as early as possible, although evidence-based research on their effectiveness for H7N9 infection is lacking. METHODS: Data from all laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 infection in Zhejiang Province between 2013 and 2017 were retrieved, and time-dependent survival models were used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors to reduce the risk of mortality. RESULTS: The final optimal model found no significant association (odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 0.78-2.15) between time to treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and survival after controlling for age and white blood cell count. Sensitivity analyses with multiple imputation for missing data concurred with the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and survival in patients with H7N9 infection using various adjusted models and sensitivity analyses of missing data imputations.","tags":["Effectiveness","H7N9 infection","Influenza","Mortality","Neuraminidase inhibitors"],"title":"Effectiveness of Neuraminidase Inhibitors to Prevent Mortality in Patients with Laboratory-Confirmed Avian Influenza A H7N9","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Molly E.

Additional information about the relative viral load could be calculated. Such quantitative information might be useful for making treatment decisions. Methods: We enrolled students at a university health center who presented with cough and 1 additional flu-like symptom from December 2016 to February 2017. Data were collected before, during, and 5 days after the clinic visit. All those enrolled in the study received a point-of-care PCR test (cobas Liat). For those patients that tested positive for influenza A, we investigated correlations between the relative viral load and measures of disease severity and recovery. Results: One hundred thirty-five students tested positive for influenza A. We found a positive correlation between viral load and body temperature. Time since symptom onset seemed to have a negative correlation but was not statistically significant. We did not find any correlations between viral load and overall symptom severity or outcomes related to recovery. Conclusions: Although we found a correlation between relative viral load and body temperature, for our study population of young, overall healthy adults, we did not find that relative viral load provided additional information that could help in determining treatment and disease outcomes. It could be that viral load does provide useful additional information for other groups of patients, such as young children or older adults. Further studies on those populations are warranted.","tags":["infection outcomes","influenza","point-of-care testing","viral load"],"title":"Associations Between Relative Viral Load at Diagnosis and Influenza A Symptoms and Recovery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiafeng Zhang","Jiaming Yao","Jun Jiang","Xiaohong Pan","Mingyu Luo","Yan Xia","Qin Fan","Xiaobei Ding","Jianjun Ruan","Andreas Handel","Justin Bahl","Wanjun Chen","Lianqi Zha","Tao Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601510400,"objectID":"a0e2dadcafdcc348f221de0c64991934","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2020-zhang-ige/","publishdate":"2020-06-30T12:31:43.676475Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-zhang-ige/","section":"publication","summary":"The HIV-1 epidemic is a remarkable public health concern in China, especially in developed trade areas.

While some symptoms may be transmission-enhancing, other symptoms are likely to reduce transmission potential. For human diseases, the reduction in transmission opportunities is commonly caused by reduced activity. There is limited data regarding the potential impact of virulence on transmission potential. We performed an exploratory data analysis of 324 influenza patients at a university health centre during the 2016/2017 influenza season. We classified symptoms as infectiousness-related or morbidity-related and calculated two scores. The scores were used to explore the relationship between infectiousness, morbidity (virulence), and activity level. We found a decrease in the activity level with increasing morbidity scores. There was no consistent pattern between an activity level and an infectiousness score. We also found a positive correlation between morbidity and infectiousness scores. Overall, we find that increasing virulence leads to increased infectiousness and reduced activity, suggesting a trade-off that can impact overall transmission potential. Our findings indicate that a reduction of systemic symptoms may increase host activity without reducing infectiousness. Therefore, interventions should target both systemic- and infectiousness-related symptoms to reduce overall transmission potential. Our findings can also inform simulation models that investigate the impact of different interventions on transmission.","tags":null,"title":"Virulence-Mediated Infectiousness and Activity Trade-Offs and Their Impact on Transmission Potential of Influenza Patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["publications"],"content":"Like most infectious disease modelers, we have gotten involved in several COVID-19 related projects recently.

Both mechanisms can explain the basic dynamics of an acute infection— exponential growth of the pathogen followed by control and clearance— and can also be represented by many different differential equation models. Consequently, traditional model comparison techniques using time series data can be ambiguous or inconclusive. We propose that varying the inoculum dose and measuring the subsequent infectious load can rule out target cell depletion by the pathogen as the main control mechanism. Infectious load can be any measure that is proportional to the number of infected cells, such as viraemia. We show that a twofold or greater change in infectious load is unlikely when target cell depletion controls infection, regardless of the model details. Analyzing previously published data from mice infected with influenza, we find the proportion of lung epithelial cells infected was 21-fold greater (95% confidence interval 14– 32) in the highest dose group than in the lowest. This provides evidence in favor of an alternative to target cell depletion, such as innate immunity, in controlling influenza infections in this experimental system. Data from other experimental animal models of acute primary infection have a similar pattern.","tags":null,"title":"Varying Inoculum Dose to Assess the Roles of the Immune Response and Target Cell Depletion by the Pathogen in Control of Acute Viral Infections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanwen Huang","Andreas Handel","Xiao Song"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"44ae6f67e541027ee851264a145de288","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2020-huang-compstat/","publishdate":"2020-06-30T12:31:43.676475Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-huang-compstat/","section":"publication","summary":"We develop a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODE) from the observed noisy data.

One advantage of the proposed method is that for some ODE systems, one can obtain closed form conditional posterior distributions for all variables which substantially reduce the computational cost and facilitate the convergence process. An efficient Riemann manifold based hybrid Monte Carlo scheme is implemented to generate samples for variables whose conditional posterior distribution cannot be written in terms of closed form.

Universities are deliberating whether, when, and how they should resume in-person instruction in Fall 2020. In this essay, we discuss some practical considerations for the use of 2 potentially useful control strategies based on testing: (1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing followed by case-patient isolation and quarantine of close contacts, and (2) serological testing followed by an _immune shield_ approach, that is, low social distancing requirements for seropositive persons. The isolation of case-patients and quarantine of close contacts may be especially challenging, and perhaps prohibitively difficult, on many university campuses. The _immune shield_ strategy might be hobbled by a low positive predictive value of the tests used in populations with low seroprevalence. Both strategies carry logistical, ethical, and financial implications. The main nonpharmaceutical interventions will remain methods based on social distancing (eg, capping class size) and personal protective behaviors (eg, universal facemask wearing in public space) until vaccines become available, or unless the issues discussed herein can be resolved in such a way that using mass testing as main control strategies becomes viable.","tags":["communicable diseases","digital health","epidemics","infectious disease transmission","social media"],"title":"SARS-CoV-2 Viral and Serological Testing When College Campuses Reopen: Some Practical Considerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

The objective of this study was to identify if the use of a new highly accurate rapid point of care test would significantly increase the likelihood of guideline consistent care. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 300 students at a university health clinic who presented with cough and 1 influenza-like illness symptom between December 2016 and February 2017 to receive care guided by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of the 300 patients receiving the PCR test, 264 had complete medical records and were compared to 771 who received usual care. We used a logistic regression model to identify whether PCR guided care was associated with guideline consistent care, based on the appropriate use of oseltamivir and antibiotics. We also assessed whether PCR guided care decreased the likelihood of return visits within 2 weeks by patients. RESULTS: Logistic regression revealed that the odds of receiving guideline supported care did not significantly increase for patients who received PCR guided care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95% CI, 0.83-1.88). It significantly decreased the likelihood of an antibiotic prescription (aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.94), increased the likelihood of receiving oseltamivir (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.09-2.28), and decreased the likelihood of return visit within 2 weeks (aOR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a rapid PCR test did not significantly improve the likelihood of guideline consistent care. However, independent of test outcome, patients who received the test were more likely to receive an antiviral and less likely to receive an antibiotic or have a return visit within 2 weeks.","tags":["Antibiotics","Antiviral Agents","Diagnostic Tests","Influenza","Point of Care Testing","Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"title":"Impact of a Rapid Point of Care Test for Influenza on Guideline Consistent Care and Antibiotic Use.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We are interested in the dynamics of influenza, both on the within-host level and the between-host level.

This interaction is important for respiratory infectious diseases, where built environments may promote transmission. To learn about time use, or the amount of time people spend in a day doing various activities, in sub-Saharan Africa may be difficult because of low literacy and different cultural perceptions of time. We developed a culturally appropriate survey tool to measure time use called the mweso game.Method:Three cross-sectional studies were performed among adults in Kampala, Uganda, to evaluate criterion and construct validity and to assess reliability of the mweso game. The mweso game was compared to actual elapsed time, a detailed 24-hr recall survey, and between three different recall periods. In all analyses, the mean number of beads, or hours, was calculated; Pearson correlation coefficients and Cronbach?s α were estimated.Results:Criterion validity for the use of beads to measure time was fair; mean values tended to be accurate, but there was variability in estimates of time across participants. When comparing the mweso game to the 24-hr recall survey, construct validity was very good. For most of the settings, the difference between measurements was less than one hour; there was good to excellent correlation for most settings. Reliability and internal consistency were best for time use at home and work.Conclusions:We have developed the mweso game as an instrument to measure time use in the context of low literacy and different cultural perceptions of time. The mweso game was valid and reliable, especially for measuring time use at home and work. With further validation, it may prove useful in measuring time use and in studying its relation to transmission of respiratory infectious diseases.","tags":null,"title":"Validation of a Pictorial Survey Tool to Measure Time Use in an African Urban Setting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brian McKay","Maria Castellanos","Mark Ebell","Christopher C.

Several meta-analyses using different methods have assessed the effectiveness of DOT compared to self-administered therapy (SAT).

Meta-analyses can guide policymaking, but such analyses must be reliable. To assess the validity of a previous meta-analysis, we tried to reproduce it. We encountered problems with the previous analysis that did not allow for a meaningful reproduction. We describe the issues we encountered here.

Outcomes in the new analysis are loss to follow-up, treatment failure, cure, treatment completed, and all-cause mortality. All data, documentation, and code used to generate our results is provided. Our new analysis included four randomized and three observational studies with 1603 and 1626 individuals respectively. The pooled relative risks (RR) are as follows: Lost to follow-up (RR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.9, 1.7), Treatment Failure (RR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.6, 2), Cure (RR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.8, 1.1), Treatment Completion (RR = 1, 95% CI 0.9, 1.1), Mortality (RR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.6, 1.3).

All these peptides, including seven novel epitopes, elicit T cell responses in infected C57BL/6 mice. Directly presented IAV epitopes maintain their relative abundance across distinct cell types and reveal a broad range of epitope abundances. In contrast, cross-presented epitopes are more uniform in abundance. We observe a clear disparity in the abundance of the two key immunodominant IAV antigens, wherein direct infection drives optimal nucleoprotein (NP)366-374 presentation, while cross-presentation is optimal for acid polymerase (PA)224-233 presentation.

An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring the impact of inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity to inform model-based vaccine design.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ME Castellanos","S Kirimunda","L Martinez","T Quach","H Woldu","R Kakaire","A Handel","S Zalwango","N Kiwanuka","CC Whalen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535774400,"objectID":"0a384c40bac842d6a041957d952f1f0d","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2018-castellanos-ijtld/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-castellanos-ijtld/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate diagnostic agreement of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test in adult tuberculin skin test (TST) converters in a high tuberculosis (TB) burden setting.

A key complication is heterogeneity in both the magnitude and decay rate of responses of different individuals to a given vaccine, as well as of a given individual to different vaccines. We analyzed longitudinal data on antibody titers in 45 individuals to characterize the extent of this heterogeneity and used models to determine how it affected the longevity of protective immunity to measles, rubella, vaccinia, tetanus, and diphtheria. Our analysis showed that the magnitude of responses in different individuals varied between 12- and 200-fold (95% coverage) depending on the antigen. Heterogeneity in the magnitude and decay rate contribute comparably to variation in the longevity of protective immunity between different individuals. We found that some individuals have, on average, slightly longer-lasting memory than others-on average, they have higher antibody levels with slower decay rates. We identified different patterns for the loss of protective levels of antibodies to different vaccine and virus antigens. Specifically, we found that for the first 25 to 50 years, virtually all individuals have protective antibody titers against diphtheria and tetanus, respectively, but about 10% of the population subsequently lose protective immunity per decade. In contrast, at the outset, not all individuals had protective titers against measles, rubella, and vaccinia. However, these antibody titers wane much more slowly, with a loss of protective immunity in only 1% to 3% of the population per decade. Our results highlight the importance of long-term longitudinal studies for estimating the duration of protective immunity and suggest both how vaccines might be improved and how boosting schedules might be reevaluated.","tags":null,"title":"Heterogeneity and longevity of antibody memory to viruses and vaccines.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["VI Zarnitsyna","I Bulusheva","A Handel","IM Longini","ME Halloran","R Antia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527825600,"objectID":"653ea409c7af34f8ece7a47f18cbcf58","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2018-zarnitsyna-plosone/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-zarnitsyna-plosone/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Intermediate levels of vaccination coverage may minimize seasonal influenza outbreaks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H Woldu","TG Heckman","A Handel","Y Shen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527220800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527220800,"objectID":"8e9854f8cdfd9daa6f12719b98da183a","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2018-woldu-jas/","publishdate":"2018-05-25T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-woldu-jas/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of parametric linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models to analyze longitudinal data collected during randomized control trials (RCT) is conventional. The application of these methods, however, is restricted due to various assumptions required by these models. When the number of observations per subject is sufficiently large, and individual trajectories are noisy, functional data analysis (FDA) methods serve as an alternative to parametric longitudinal data analysis techniques. However, the use of FDA in RCTs is rare. In this paper, the effectiveness of FDA and linear mixed models (LMMs) was compared by analyzing data from rural persons living with HIV and comorbid depression enrolled in a depression treatment randomized clinical trial. Interactive voice response systems were used for weekly administrations of the 10-item Self-Administered Depression Scale (SADS) over 41 weeks. Functional principal component analysis and functional regression analysis methods detected a statistically significant difference in SADS between telphone-administered interpersonal psychotherapy (tele-IPT) and controls but linear mixed effects model results did not. Additional simulation studies were conducted to compare FDA and LMMs under a different nonlinear trajectory assumption. In this clinical trial with sufficient per subject measured outcomes and individual trajectories that are noisy and nonlinear, we found FDA methods to be a better alternative to LMMs.","tags":null,"title":"Applying functional data analysis to assess tele-interpersonal psychotherapy's efficacy to reduce depression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Martinez","A Handel","Y Shen","S Chakraburty","FD Quinn","CM Stein","LL Malone","S Zalwango","CC Whalen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525147200,"objectID":"94ed0d941af4b4599a1f689a391bb664","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2018-martinez-ajrccm/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-martinez-ajrccm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Prospective Validation of a Clinical Algorithm to Detect Tuberculosis in Child Contacts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Martinez","Y Shen","A Handel","S Chakraburty","CM Stein","LL Malone","WH Boom","FD Quinn","ML Joloba","CC Whalen","S Zalwango"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522555200,"objectID":"c02684b2250d0c709b319c82d473f763","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2018-martinez-lancetrm/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-martinez-lancetrm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Effectiveness of WHO's pragmatic screening algorithm for child contacts of tuberculosis cases in resource-constrained settings: a prospective cohort study in Uganda","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Handel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"b46f82bdfd6e19c64a00a5557f619878","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2017-handel-qrb/","publishdate":"2019-11-06T23:36:56.372497Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-handel-qrb/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Cell Biology by the Numbers by Ron Milo and Rob Phillips","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Handel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506830400,"objectID":"86e70f47f2017189c713b5d905c651bc","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2017-handel-pcb/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-handel-pcb/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning infectious disease epidemiology in a modern framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JD Ooi","J Petersen","YH Tan","M Huynh","ZJ Willett","SH Ramarathinam","PJ Eggenhuizen","KL Loh","KA Watson","PY Gan","MAA Likhan","NL Dudek","A Handel","BG Hudson","L Fugger","DA Power","SG Holt","PT Coates","JW Gregersen","AW Purcell","SR Holdsworth","NL La Gruta","HH Reid","J Rossjohn","AR Kitching"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493611200,"objectID":"b7c75e1d9239d79c55f632f5c8fc0e3a","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2017-ooi-nature/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-ooi-nature/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Dominant protection from HLA-linked autoimmunity by antigen-specific regulatory T cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Ragonnet","JM Trauer","ES McBryde","RMGJ Houben","JT Denholm","A Handel","T Sumner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483246800,"objectID":"680e4d385aa1ac9370b9800b19ae9602","permalink":"https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2017-ragonnet-ijtld/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-ragonnet-ijtld/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Is IPT more effective in high-burden settings?
