      <guid>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/news/updates-summer-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://handelgroup.uga.edu/author/rachel-mercaldo/&#34;&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt; successfully graduated in spring of 2021 and is now working as a Postdoc at the NIH!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had two great REU students join us this summer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://handelgroup.uga.edu/author/jacqueline-dworaczyk/&#34;&gt;Jacqueline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://handelgroup.uga.edu/author/salil-goyal/&#34;&gt;Salil&lt;/a&gt;. They made a lot of progress on each of their projects during the summer. Expect to see papers published on those topics soon üòÉ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We published a few more papers, they can all be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publications/&#34;&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; section of the website. (Well, not anymore, but you can find a link there to locations where you can find them üòÅ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with his colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stjude.org/directory/t/paul-thomas.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Paul Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Handel taught another year of within-host modeling and immunology at &lt;a href=&#34;https://andreashandel.github.io/SISMID2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SISMID 2021&lt;/a&gt;. This was the 13th year of teaching this workshop. Materials used in this workshop can be found on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Simulation Modeling and Immunology website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made updates to the website, mostly simplifying things. Let me know if anything does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/allprojects/influenzavaccines/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are using modeling and analysis approaches to determine how to optimize vaccine formulation, with a focus on the impact of dose for future universal influenza vaccines. The work is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.niaidcivics.org/center-for-influenza-vaccine-research-for-high-risk-populations-civr-hrp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Center for Influenza Vaccine Research for High-Risk Populations (CIVR-HRP)&lt;/a&gt;, which is a component of NIH&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.niaidcivics.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs) program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Model-guided vaccines for norovirus</title>
      <link>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/allprojects/norovirusvaccines/</link>

      <guid>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/allprojects/norovirusvaccines/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are working on better understanding aspects of norovirus within-host and epidemiological dynamics and potential control. We analyze and model data that can inform the development and deployment of future norovirus vaccines. This is part of an NIH funded project with collaborators &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blopman.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ben Lopman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/koellelab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Katia Koelle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sph.emory.edu/research/centers/leonlab/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Juan Leon&lt;/a&gt; at Emory, as well as colleagues from other universities, the CDC and Takeda.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updates for the new year</title>
      <link>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/news/updates-for-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/news/updates-for-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, a new PhD student, &lt;a href=&#34;https://handelgroup.uga.edu/author/w-zane-billings/&#34;&gt;Zane&lt;/a&gt;, joined our group. He previously did an REU in our group and liked it enough to apply to our PhD program and now joined the team. He&amp;rsquo;ll be working on influenza vaccines and we are excited to have him part of the team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also published several more COVID-19 papers (as well as a few non-COVID ones), they can all be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publications/&#34;&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; section of the website, and you can filter there by topic/pathogen if you are especially (not) interested in COVID üòÉ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to that, slides for several COVID (and also a few non-COVID) presentations that I gave are available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.andreashandel.com/talk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on my personal website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also updated this website to the latest Hugo/Academic (now Wowchemy) theme, so if anything doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/news/a-few-more-publications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently had a few new publications come out: One of the PhD thesis chapters of our former student Brian got published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, and we had a few COVID related papers come out, as well as a few on assorted other infectious disease topics. All publications can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publications/&#34;&gt;publications section&lt;/a&gt; of this page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Several COVID-19 related projects</title>
      <link>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/news/several-covid-19-projects/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/news/several-covid-19-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like most infectious disease modelers, we have gotten involved in several COVID-19 related projects recently. 
A lot of work is done as part of UGA&amp;rsquo;s Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, most of those projects &lt;a href=&#34;http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One project is our visualization of COVID-19 cases/deaths. &lt;a href=&#34;https://shiny.ovpr.uga.edu/yact/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This shiny app is here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a few projects exist as pre-prints. One analyzes &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025973&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mass screening and testing interventions&lt;/a&gt; another looks at &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034892&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reduction of mortality if containment is not possible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.5225&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this one analyzes multiple likely airborne transmissions on a bus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa231&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this one looks at several transmission events during casual contact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Handel also described most of these projects in a recent presentation at GA Southern, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.andreashandel.com/presentations/2020-04-gasouthern-covid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here are the slides from this talk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modeling and analysis of influenza immune responses</title>
      <link>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/allprojects/influenzaimmunity/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://handelgroup.uga.edu/allprojects/influenzaimmunity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We want to understand what mechanisms lead to good induction of memory immune responses following vaccination, and what mechanisms influence the severity of infections. To that end, we combine statistical and mechanistic models with data. We work on several projects in this area, some are part of the the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.niaidcivics.org/center-for-influenza-vaccine-research-for-high-risk-populations-civr-hrp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Center for Influenza Vaccine Research for High-Risk Populations (CIVR-HRP)&lt;/a&gt;, others are part of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research (CIDER), a component of NIH&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ceirr-network.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR)&lt;/a&gt;, and some are part of the project &lt;a href=&#34;https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10204919&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dynamics and Evolution of Immune Responses to Influenza Viruses&lt;/a&gt; with colleague &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biology.emory.edu/Antia/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Rustom Antia as PI&lt;/a&gt; and other collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
