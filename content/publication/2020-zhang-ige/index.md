abstract: "The HIV-1 epidemic is a remarkable public health concern in China, especially in developed trade areas. We aimed to investigate the interaction of migration with the local transmission network in a typical trade area, Yiwu City, the world's largest commodity distribution center. Based on 390 pol sequences from 413 participants diagnosed between 2014 and 2016, putative transmission clusters and the underlying demographic and behavioral characteristics were analyzed. Recent infection status was determined by HIV-1 limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay to identify active clusters. Multiple subtypes were identified, with a predominance of CRF01_AE (47.4%) and CRF07_BC (40.8%), followed by 9 other subtypes and 8 URFs. Multivariable analyses revealed that individuals in clusters were more likely to be local residents, infected through heterosexual behaviors, and infected with CRF01_AE (P~$<~$.05). Of men who have sex with men (MSM), 81% were linked to other MSM, and only 3% were linked to heterosexual women. Of heterosexual women, 67% were linked to heterosexual men, and 11% to MSM. Yiwu residents were more likely to link to locals than that of migrants (43% vs 20%, P~$<~$.001). By contrast, local MSM and migrant MSM all had high percentages of linkage to migrant MSM (57% vs 69%, P~=~.069). Our findings reveal that migration promotes the dissemination and dynamic change of HIV, which are interwoven between locals and migrants. The results highlight the far-reaching influence of migrant MSM on the local HIV transmission network."
