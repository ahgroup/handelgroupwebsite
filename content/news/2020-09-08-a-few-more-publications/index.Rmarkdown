We recently had a few new publications come out: One of the PhD thesis chapters of our former student Brian got published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, and we had a few COVID related papers come out, as well as a few on assorted other infectious disease topics. All publications can be found in the [publications section](/publications/) of this page.
