Nobody from the group graduated last year, but [Hayley Hemme](/author/hayley-hemme/) joined our group as a new PhD student!

As usual, we kept publishing a few papers, which you can learn more about in the [publications](/publications/) section of the website. 

And again, this time for year number 15, Dr. Handel, together with his colleague [Paul Thomas](https://www.stjude.org/directory/t/paul-thomas.html), taught within-host modeling and immunology at [SISMID 2023](https://andreashandel.github.io/SISMID2023/). After 3 years online, this one was in person in Seattle (likely for the last time at this location). We didn't record the presentations, but slides and other materials are on the link just mentioned, or can be reached from there.
