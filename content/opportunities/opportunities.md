### General Information

We use mathematical, statistical and computational methods to analyze and model infectious diseases. We do not perform any lab experiments or do field work to collect data. Instead, we closely collaborate with experimentalists and field epidemiologists. 

Any of our projects need analytical and computational skills. Most projects require some level of computer programming, mostly done in the R language. For any project, a willingness to learn both the analytical/computational tools and the details of the biological system are crucial.

I usually have ideas for projects, and I'm also open to any new ideas, as long as they fall broadly into the area of infectious disease modeling and analysis on either the population level or the level of the individual infected host.


### Opportunities for Postdocs

I am currently not actively recruiting. But I am always interested to hear from qualified candidates. Positions often 
come available without much warning. So if you are close to finishing your PhD and you are interested in the work we 
do, don't hesitate to contact me. Also contact me if you are interested in joining the group and you can bring our 
own funding, or you want to develop a proposal for funding based on possible work in our group. Finally, I am open to 
joint Postdoc arrangements between my group and others, for instance colleagues from [CEID](http://ceid.uga.edu/) 
or anywhere else at UGA and beyond.


### Opportunities for Graduate Students

If you are a current UGA student and interested in our research, contact me and we can discuss if there are ways you can get involved. Also check out 
opportunities for external funding described below. And if you want to write a proposal with me as mentor, please contact 
me and we can discuss possible projects. 

If you are not currently a UGA student, you can reach out but you would need to apply to and be admitted by our program in order to formally do research (and receive financial support) in our group.


### Opportunities for Undergraduate Students

I often have projects that might be suitable for undergraduate students. You will either need to know or be willing 
to learn programming in R and some statistics or differential equation modeling. Most of the undergraduate students who have worked with me for at least a year ended up as co-authors on one or several publications. If you are interested in doing some infectious 
disease research, contact me.


### External funding Opportunities

Sometimes I have funding for students and postdocs, sometimes I don't. In either case, it is very useful for you to apply for your own funding. Getting a grant or fellowship looks very good on your CV. It also gives you more flexibility and security. Below is a list of external funding sources for students and postdocs. Entries are listed in no particular order. This list is by no means complete, and I'm not updating it too often. If you know of any good sources I omitted, or if you find outdated information, please let me know.
