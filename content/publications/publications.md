I used to list all our publications here, with the ability to filter by topic. It was nice, but it was very tedious to maintain, Hugo/Wowchemy kept breaking things all the time. So I finally gave up. Now, instead of trying to manage my publications on this website, I'm just pointing you to my (fairly well maintained) publication entries at [NCBI/NIH My Bibliography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/1lO-aqCZWgr5F/bibliography/public/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bruHK0YAAAAJ&hl=en).

I also used to have the pdfs of all my papers here. This doesn't work anymore with the new setup. **But if for any reason there is a paper you want to get and can't, contact me and I'd be happy to send you the pdf.**

Also, there are some papers that [members of our group](/people/) co-authored on which I am not listed. To find those, go to that group member's website.
